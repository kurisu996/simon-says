# simon-says
Hi!!
This is my first Project for High Seas from Hack Club and it is a Simon Says game for the Browser!!

Press the Startbutton to start the game!
Then you hear a sequence of sounds and the colors highlight that are corresponding to the sound.
after that you have to press the colors in the same sequence.
when you complete one sequence another color will be added to the sequence.
press the wrong color and the game will end.
